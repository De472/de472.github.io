    My graduation is schedule to be at the end of 2022 if everything goes right.<br>
    I'm currently looking for an IT job/intership, specifically something that involves software development, because it would be
    related to my studies and I want to start my career as a developer. Between front-end and back-end development I have
    an easier time with back-end, but I can always spend some time searching documentations, videos or web forums.<br><br>",
